    <h2>The Best Homemade Pasta Carbonara</h2>
    <p>This easy pasta carbonara recipe is made with a few ingredients—eggs, Parmesan cheese, pancetta, and pepper—yet delivers a rich, comforting dish. It’s a quick meal, perfect for a weeknight dinner.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces spaghetti or bucatini</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 ounces pancetta, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>    
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the pasta:</h4>
            <p>Bring a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 4 quarts of water) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the pancetta:</h4>
            <p>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the pancetta until crispy, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, being careful not to burn it. Remove the skillet from heat and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the egg and cheese mixture:</h4>
            <p>In a small bowl, whisk the eggs and Parmesan cheese together until smooth.</p>
        </li> 
        <li>
            <h4>Toss the pasta with the pancetta:</h4>
            <p>Return the drained pasta to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to coat the pasta in the pancetta fat. If the pasta seems dry, add a small amount of the reserved pasta water to loosen it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add the egg and cheese mixture:</h4>
            <p>Quickly add the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, tossing constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Continue to toss until the pasta is well coated and creamy. Add more pasta water if needed to achieve a silky texture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Serve:</h4>
            <p>Season with freshly ground black pepper and more Parmesan cheese if desired. Serve immediately.</p>
        </li>   
    </ol>
