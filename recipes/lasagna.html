    <h2>The Best Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>    
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Put pasta water on to boil:</h4>
            <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. While waiting for the water to boil, prepare the sauce in the next steps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Brown the ground beef:</h4>
            <p>In a large skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until lightly browned. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain excess fat, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the skillet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:</h4>
            <p>Add diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until the onions are translucent and the peppers are softened. Add minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Return the browned ground beef to the pan and cook for an additional 5 minutes on low heat.</p>
        </li> 
        <li>
            <h4>Make the sauce:</h4>
            <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Add parsley, oregano, and Italian seasoning. Season with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste. Sprinkle with vinegar and sugar (optional). Adjust salt to taste. Simmer for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</h4>
            <p>Cook the lasagna noodles in the boiling water until al dente according to package instructions. Stir often to prevent sticking. Drain and rinse with cool water. Lay the noodles on an oiled baking sheet to prevent sticking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Assemble the lasagna:</h4>
            <p>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a cup of sauce on the bottom. Layer lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by another layer of sauce. Add grated mozzarella, dollops of ricotta cheese, and grated Parmesan. Repeat layers, finishing with sauce and mozzarella on top.</p>
